            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Here's a part of my story</h1><p>I used to be a rocket scientist. Really. Right out of university my very first job was designing airplanes and rockets and I became really, really good at using 3D software. My 3D skills eventually led me to work for a very famous architect, then working in special effects, digital media companies and movie studios.

As a producer I have led projects from big, complex interactives for Fortune 100 corporations to branding for small businesses and non-profits.  As a designer I've created and launched online products for studios, designed websites for non-profit organizations, created branding, print material and website for a variety of startups, and designed websites for artists and musicians.

I am a long time resident of West Hollywood, California (The Creative City!) and when Iâ€™m not working, I am focused on grad school... someday I'll get back to pursuing my interests in music, art, music, photography, architecture, traveling or just trying to find a great new place to eat. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/933722bcce6fa3e4a24f11f11f6fefa0a3ecc41d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
