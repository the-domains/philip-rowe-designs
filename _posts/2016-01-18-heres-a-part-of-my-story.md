# Here's a part of my story
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/14526dd7-ef5d-4f55-bc75-dc5e97fd226a.jpg)

I used to be a rocket scientist. Really. Right out of university my very first job was designing airplanes and rockets and I became really, really good at using 3D software. My 3D skills eventually led me to work for a very famous architect, then working in special effects, digital media companies and movie studios.
As a producer I have led projects from big, complex interactives for Fortune 100 corporations to branding for small businesses and non-profits. As a designer I've created and launched online products for studios, designed websites for non-profit organizations, created branding, print material and website for a variety of startups, and designed websites for artists and musicians.
I am a long time resident of West Hollywood, California (The Creative City!) and when I'm not working, I am focused on grad school... someday I'll get back to pursuing my interests in music, art, music, photography, architecture, traveling or just trying to find a great new place to eat.
